# CFlow Execution Foundation: Platform, Concurrency, Clock, Executor, and Timer

**Date:** 2026-08-22

## Status

Approved architecture for the execution substrate beneath CFlow and the corresponding Core refactor. This design intentionally stops before Event, Mailbox, Machine, Actor, IO reactor, or minicoro integration. Those layers consume the contracts defined here.

## Architectural decision

Adopt this dependency contract:

```text
Platform
  ↓
Concurrency
  ↓
CFlow
  ↓
Core

CMeta ─────→ CFlow
CMeta ─────→ TurboSTL
Core  ─────→ CMeta / CFlow / TurboSTL / Platform / Concurrency
```

The precise rule is:

```text
Platform
  → OS APIs / Threads only

Concurrency
  → Platform

CMeta
  → no Platform/Concurrency dependency unless a concrete need appears

CFlow
  → CMeta
  → Platform
  → Concurrency

TurboSTL
  → CMeta

Core
  → CMeta
  → TurboSTL
  → Platform
  → Concurrency
  → may depend on CFlow without a cycle
```

Core is therefore an upper-level common runtime/utilities module, not the owner of every low-level primitive.

## Why this refactor is needed

CFlow already contains the important protocol of a generic resumable runtime: `cflow_resumable`, `CFLOW_STEP_WAIT`, `cflow_waitable`, `cflow_waker`, a deterministic test scheduler, and a concurrent worker scheduler.

The current implementation nevertheless mixes four responsibilities:

- reading time;
- deciding when delayed work is ready;
- deciding where ready work executes;
- implementing OS thread/mutex/condition mechanics.

Two concrete problems follow.

First, `cflow/src/scheduler_worker.c` owns a second worker pool based on C11 `<threads.h>` and computes deadlines with `timespec_get(..., TIME_UTC)`. Wall-clock time can jump. Timeout, delay, retry, debounce, scheduling, and future Machine temporal transitions must use monotonic time.

Second, Core currently owns lower-level execution primitives needed by CFlow: `utils/turbo_thread.*` implements thread/sync plus a disruptor-backed thread pool, while `utils/disruptor.*` is itself a generic concurrency primitive. Making CFlow depend on Core would invert the dependency graph and prevent Core from using CFlow later.

The fix is to move those primitives below Core.

## Goals

1. Make Core structurally able to use CFlow and CMeta without cycles.
2. Make `TurboUtils::Platform` own OS clock/thread/synchronization primitives.
3. Make `TurboUtils::Concurrency` own disruptor and the existing thread pool.
4. Remove direct `<threads.h>`, pthread, and Win32 thread use from CFlow execution code.
5. Give CFlow one explicit monotonic-time model for deadlines and elapsed time.
6. Preserve deterministic virtual-time scheduling.
7. Separate **when work becomes ready** from **where work executes**.
8. Preserve `cflow_scheduler` as a compatibility facade during migration.
9. Make serialized execution a first-class policy for future Machine/Actor use.
10. Give each module its own target-scoped visibility/export contract.

## Non-goals

This phase does not implement Event/Mailbox, Machine/Statechart IR, Actor runtime, minicoro integration, IOCP/epoll/kqueue reactor integration, affinity/NUMA/work-stealing policy, or a new disruptor/thread-pool algorithm.

---

## Module ownership

### `TurboUtils::Platform`

Platform is the lowest TurboUtils runtime module and owns portable OS primitives only:

- monotonic high-resolution clock;
- realtime timestamp clock;
- thread create/join/detach;
- mutex;
- read/write lock;
- condition variable;
- once initialization;
- thread-local storage abstraction;
- thread yield/sleep;
- CPU-count query.

Platform does **not** own thread pools, task queues, disruptor, CMeta interfaces, CFlow scheduling, logging, filesystem/process utilities, or application-level policy.

`turbo_sync_set_single_threaded()` / `turbo_sync_is_single_threaded()` are explicitly **not** Platform primitives. They are a global policy over higher-level shared resources and remain Core-owned until a later policy refactor.

Platform must not depend on CMeta, CFlow, TurboSTL, Core, SDS, logging, disruptor, or Concurrency.

### `TurboUtils::Concurrency`

Concurrency owns generic concurrent execution/data structures independent of CFlow semantics:

- disruptor;
- the existing disruptor-backed `turbo_threadpool`;
- task queue/worker management required by that pool.

Concurrency depends only on Platform plus the C standard library/atomics.

It does not know about `cmeta_callable`, CFlow Graph/Stream/Machine semantics, CFlow waitables, logging, or Core utilities.

### `TurboUtils::CFlow`

CFlow owns execution semantics:

- Graph/Stream/runtime semantics;
- resumable/waitable/waker protocol;
- Clock abstraction;
- Executor abstraction;
- TimerQueue/deadline semantics;
- scheduler facade and policy composition.

CFlow may adapt the Concurrency thread pool as WorkerExecutor, but Concurrency never depends on CFlow.

### `TurboUtils::Core`

Core remains the upper-level utilities/runtime module: fmt/tlog, filesystem/process/mmap, strings/buffers, UUID/compression/regex/automata, system information, and other application-facing utilities.

Core may use CFlow internally. CFlow is a `PRIVATE` Core dependency unless a Core public header actually exposes CFlow types.

Core remains `PUBLIC` on CMeta where Core public headers expose CMeta-generated metadata.

---

## Physical layout and compatibility

New focused ownership:

```text
platform/
  CMakeLists.txt
  include/turbo/
    platform.h
    clock.h
    thread.h
  src/
    clock.c
    thread.c

concurrency/
  CMakeLists.txt
  include/turbo/
    concurrency.h
    disruptor.h
    thread_pool.h
  src/
    disruptor.c
    thread_pool.c
```

Existing includes remain compatibility surfaces during migration:

```text
utils/include/platform.h
utils/include/turbo_thread.h
utils/include/disruptor.h
```

`utils/include/turbo_thread.h` becomes a compatibility aggregate over `<turbo/thread.h>` and `<turbo/thread_pool.h>`, plus the Core-owned global synchronization-policy declarations.

`utils/include/disruptor.h` becomes a compatibility include of `<turbo/disruptor.h>`.

`utils/include/platform.h` becomes a compatibility facade: focused clock primitives come from Platform while genuinely Core-owned calendar/system-info/native-timer APIs may remain there initially.

Core's own linkage marker moves to a focused `utils/include/turbo_api.h`; new Platform/Concurrency headers do not inherit Core's export state.

---

## Visibility contract

Each module owns its producer/consumer visibility state.

Conceptual markers:

```text
TURBO_PLATFORM_API / TURBO_PLATFORM_C_API
TURBO_CONCURRENCY_API / TURBO_CONCURRENCY_C_API
TURBO_API / TURBO_C_API                    // Core only
```

On Windows, CMake owns shared-library producer/consumer state per target. Public headers do not inspect CMake `*_EXPORTS`, `BUILD_SHARED`, or `USE_SHARED` implementation macros.

If Platform/Concurrency start as static libraries, their API markers may be empty on Windows. The module-local contract still exists for a future shared build.

Public Platform/Concurrency headers must not define `_POSIX_C_SOURCE`, `_DEFAULT_SOURCE`, `_XOPEN_SOURCE`, or `_DARWIN_C_SOURCE`; feature-test state belongs to implementation files or target-private definitions.

---

## Time model

CFlow distinguishes wall time from control time:

```text
Realtime timestamp
  → logging / telemetry / persistence / display

Monotonic instant
  → timeout / delay / retry / debounce / scheduling / temporal transitions
```

CFlow control behavior uses monotonic time only.

### Platform clock backend

- Windows: `QueryPerformanceCounter` / `QueryPerformanceFrequency`.
- POSIX: `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...)`.
- Realtime remains a separate API.

Existing `turbo_hrtime()`, `turbo_monotonic_ms()`, `turbo_realtime_ms()`, and `turbo_uptime_ms()` become Platform-owned compatibility behavior.

### CFlow semantic time types

```c
typedef struct cflow_duration { uint64_t ns; } cflow_duration;
typedef struct cflow_instant  { uint64_t ns; } cflow_instant;
typedef struct cflow_deadline { uint64_t ns; } cflow_deadline;
```

Required operations include ns/us/ms/s duration constructors, saturating instant-plus-duration, comparisons, remaining-duration calculation, and explicit legacy millisecond conversion.

### CFlow Clock

Two first-class implementations:

- SystemClock: Platform monotonic time;
- VirtualClock: deterministic logical time controlled by tests/replay.

Manual advancement is a VirtualClock capability; system time never advances artificially.

---

## Thread/timed-wait semantics

Platform thread primitives preserve current external behavior except for one semantic correction: relative condition-variable timeout means **elapsed monotonic duration**.

The current POSIX implementation derives an absolute deadline from `CLOCK_REALTIME`; that must be replaced with a monotonic condition-variable clock where supported. Windows already provides relative timeout behavior.

CFlow never sees pthread/Win32 types.

---

## Concurrency thread pool

The existing disruptor-backed thread pool is moved, not rewritten. Queue capacity, MPMC submission, shutdown rejection, pending/wait behavior, and statistics are regression contracts.

Canonical API becomes `<turbo/thread_pool.h>`; legacy `"turbo_thread.h"` remains an aggregate during migration.

---

## Executor model

Executor answers only:

> Where and under what serialization policy does a ready task execute?

It does not own time.

Initial implementations:

- ManualExecutor: no background thread; explicitly driven;
- SerialExecutor: multi-producer, at most one active callback;
- WorkerExecutor: adapter over `TurboUtils::Concurrency` thread pool;
- optional InlineExecutor for narrow integrations where reentrancy is accepted.

Future Machine/Actor mutation uses SerialExecutor by default.

---

## TimerQueue model

TimerQueue answers:

> When does a task become ready?

It stores monotonic deadlines plus stable insertion order.

Rules:

- earlier deadlines first;
- equal deadline FIFO;
- arithmetic saturates;
- cancellation succeeds only while pending;
- cancellation does not pretend to stop already-running user code.

Worker scheduling may use one Platform coordinator thread/condition wait around the earliest deadline; CFlow does not need one native OS timer per delayed task.

The existing Core `turbo_timer_*` remains an application-facing native-timer API for now and is not the CFlow TimerQueue abstraction.

---

## Scheduler compatibility facade

The existing public `cflow_scheduler` stays intact.

```text
Test scheduler
  = VirtualClock + ManualExecutor + TimerQueue

Worker scheduler
  = SystemClock + WorkerExecutor + TimerQueue
```

Legacy `post_after(delay_ticks,...)` treats ticks as milliseconds, converts to typed duration, computes a saturating monotonic deadline, and schedules into TimerQueue.

`now()` returns monotonic milliseconds through the legacy facade.

`advance()` is meaningful only for the virtual-clock backend.

`run_one/run_ready/run_until_idle` drive ManualExecutor/TimerQueue deterministically.

---

## Core dependency direction

The architectural rule is:

```text
CFlow never depends on Core.
Core may depend on CFlow.
```

Core links CFlow privately while only implementation files use it. A public dependency is added only if Core public headers expose CFlow declarations.

This gives tlog/process/driver-style Core facilities a future path to use CFlow internally without forcing CFlow upward into Core.

---

## Future Event/Machine/thread semantics

Future Event producers may run on arbitrary threads but do not mutate Machine state directly:

```text
producer A ─┐
producer B ─┼─> Mailbox ─> SerialExecutor ─> Machine
producer C ─┘
```

Independent CPU/IO work can run on WorkerExecutor; completion returns as an Event.

Machine state is serialized by construction rather than mutexing every transition.

---

## Relationship to resumable/minicoro

```text
Resumable
  VALUE / DONE / ERROR / WAIT
              ↓
            Waker
              ↓
Scheduler facade
              ↓
    Clock + Timer + Executor
              ↓
         Concurrency
              ↓
           Platform
```

Machine and minicoro adapters consume this stack. minicoro remains an optional backend/adaptor, not the public CFlow model.

---

## Build-system contract

CMake configure order may place TinyTest before Platform/Concurrency so their test subdirectories can create TinyTest-linked test targets. Configure order is not the production dependency graph.

Recommended top-level order:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(tools)
include(FindTools)
add_subdirectory(vendor)
add_subdirectory(tinytest)
add_subdirectory(platform)
add_subdirectory(concurrency)
add_subdirectory(cmeta)
add_subdirectory(cflow)
add_subdirectory(turbostl)
add_subdirectory(utils)
add_subdirectory(turbo_serial)
```

Production dependencies:

```text
TurboUtils::Platform
  → Threads/OS only

TurboUtils::Concurrency
  → TurboUtils::Platform

TurboUtils::CFlow
  PUBLIC  TurboUtils::CMeta
  PRIVATE TurboUtils::Platform
          TurboUtils::Concurrency

TurboUtils::Core
  PUBLIC  TurboUtils::CMeta
          TurboUtils::Platform / Concurrency while compatibility headers expose them
  PRIVATE TurboUtils::STL
          TurboUtils::CFlow when implementation uses it
          existing third-party libraries
```

CFlow no longer links `Threads::Threads` directly after migration; Platform owns that dependency.

All new targets participate in `TurboUtilsTargets` install/export.

---

## Migration phases

1. Split Core `TURBO_API` from the old broad `platform.h`.
2. Introduce Platform and move clock primitives.
3. Move thread/mutex/cond/rwlock/once/yield/sleep/CPU-count to Platform; keep global sync policy Core-owned.
4. Introduce Concurrency and move disruptor.
5. Move the existing thread pool into Concurrency.
6. Add CFlow typed time + SystemClock/VirtualClock.
7. Add Manual/Serial/Worker Executor and internal TimerQueue.
8. Rebuild both scheduler backends from the new components.
9. Finish Core ownership/link/export cleanup.
10. Run package/install and cross-platform verification.

Downstream only after this foundation is stable: Event + Mailbox, Machine IR, Event transitions, Machine->resumable, timer Events, minicoro->resumable, Actor/hierarchical Machine/temporal Stream operators.

---

## Testing strategy

### Platform

- monotonic observations do not decrease;
- realtime and monotonic APIs remain distinct;
- thread create/join/detach preserved;
- mutex/cond/rwlock/once preserved;
- timed condition waits obey elapsed monotonic duration;
- strict C11/C++17 public-header compilation;
- module visibility does not reuse Core export state.

### Concurrency

Retain existing disruptor worker-wait, broadcast, worker-pool and ring behavior tests. Retain existing thread-pool MPMC submission, queue capacity, shutdown rejection, pending/wait and stats tests. These tests link Concurrency directly rather than Core.

### CFlow

- typed duration conversion/saturation;
- VirtualClock exact advancement without real sleeping;
- TimerQueue ordering/FIFO/cancellation;
- Manual/Serial/Worker executor semantics;
- legacy scheduler milliseconds;
- worker scheduler monotonic deadlines;
- existing runtime/close/wake concurrency behavior.

### Integration

Core-only compatibility consumers include legacy `platform.h`, `turbo_thread.h`, and `disruptor.h` and link only `TurboUtils::Core`, relying on declared transitive dependencies rather than manual link additions.

Linux/Windows/macOS/Android-supported builds exercise the module boundaries and installed package exports.

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. `TurboUtils::Platform` exists and has no upper-layer dependencies.
2. `TurboUtils::Concurrency` exists and depends only on Platform plus standard/OS facilities.
3. disruptor and thread-pool implementations are no longer Core-owned.
4. the global single-threaded synchronization policy remains outside Platform.
5. CFlow scheduler/runtime has no direct `<threads.h>`, pthread, or Win32 thread use.
6. CFlow delayed work uses monotonic time only.
7. WorkerExecutor reuses Concurrency rather than a second worker pool.
8. VirtualClock remains deterministic.
9. legacy public include paths remain source-compatible during migration.
10. Platform/Concurrency export state is target-scoped and independent of Core.
11. Core can depend on CFlow without a cycle.
12. existing Platform/disruptor/thread-pool/CFlow behavior tests pass under their new owners.
13. installed package exports usable Platform, Concurrency, CMeta, CFlow, STL, and Core targets.

## Architectural consequence

The project gains a real execution stack:

```text
what runs      → Task / Resumable
when it runs   → Clock + TimerQueue
where it runs  → Executor
how it runs    → Concurrency
on what OS     → Platform
```

and a clean semantic stack:

```text
Event / Machine / Actor / Stream / minicoro adapter
                    ↓
            CFlow Resumable
                    ↓
       Clock + Timer + Executor
                    ↓
             Concurrency
                    ↓
               Platform
```

> **OS mechanics belong to Platform; generic concurrent execution belongs to Concurrency; execution semantics belong to CFlow; higher-level utilities and policy belong to Core. Core may use CFlow, but CFlow never reaches upward into Core.**
